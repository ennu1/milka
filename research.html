                    My research focuses on three core themes: regulation and governance of civil society organizations,
                    inequality and elites in civil society and civil society development in hybrid regimes. One of my
                    central questions of interest is how the state and capacity building organizations - through legal
                    regulation, guidance and training - shape the internal governance of civil society organizations,
                    affecting their leadership composition and representation. I am also interested in the reproduction
                    of civil society elites and their contestation by grassroots and elite actors in long-lived
                    democracies. Currently, I am developing a comparative research project on the democratic potential
                    of civil society organizations in the Western Balkans.

                        The state largely defines the environments in which CSOs operate. This research theme focuses on
                        the ways in which external pressures from the state affect different aspects of the governance
                        of CSOs: internal democracy, professionalization, staff influence and board composition among
                        others. The theme also encompasses studies in the different ways in which liberal democracies
                        use legal regulation to constrain and enable CSO behaviour. Theoretically, it draws on debates
                        in comparative politics, public policy, legal studies, and organisational sociology.
                        Empirically, it focuses on long-lived democracies in Europe and diverse data including
                        organisational case studies, interviews, archival research and organisational surveys.

                        Civil societies in Europe are undergoing increased hierarchization and resource stratification
                        with some CSOs having disproportionate access to political and economic resources. Within this
                        line of research, I have been studying mainly the composition (who are the civil society
                        elites?), reproduction (how are they recruited, trained and legitimized?) and contestation of
                        civil society elites (who and how is challenging their position of power?) in the UK, but also
                        contributed to comparative studies in which UK is one of the cases. Theoretically, I have been
                        drawing on debates in sociology of elites, social movement studies, management and leadership
                        studies. Empirically, I have analysed prosopographic (biographical) data, interviews and
                        documents.

                        Interest group systems in the Western Balkans have undergone process of maturation with the
                        emergence of new interests and networks of CSOs. Under this theme I aim to assess the democratic
                        potential of CSOs in the Western Balkans in light of three decades of civil society capacity
                        development efforts by the EU and foreign donors. Simultaneously, I want to understand how
                        illiberal and authoritarian tendencies typical for hybrid regimes affect the ability of CSOs to
                        connect the citizens with the state. Theoretically, the study benefits from interest group
                        research, Europeanization studies and literature on political regimes. Empirically, it draws on
                        document analysis, case studies and organisational surveys.
