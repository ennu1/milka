                    To date I have delivered lectures and seminars for BA and MA students in UK and Sweden. Also, I have
                    supervised BA and MA theses at Lund University and one at University of Ljubljana. In terms of
                    substantive topics, I have taught courses in comparative political science, public policy,
                    development theories and social science research methods. I have received pedagogical training on
                    Learning and Teaching in Higher Education in the UK (2018) and Sweden (2021-2022).

                    As a teacher I often assume the role of a guide and fellow traveller who helps the students discover
                    and make sense of new knowledge. Hence, in my teaching I put emphasis on experiential learning and
                    active and inclusive engagement.
